graph.csv file(dataflow graph) is the input file to the asap.py 
the python code takes the input from the csv file and implements the ASAP algorithm.
in the console,we can see the operations which are implemented in different time slots.

Also in this python code,we write a verilog code for the same graph in "verilog.v"file.

{graph.jpg is the visual representation of the dataflow graph}
